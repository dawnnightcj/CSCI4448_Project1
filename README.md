###Comments and Assumption:
In the Zoo folder, it contains the details of this project; The Animal.java and ZooEmployee.java are the abstract class for different kind of animals and Zookeeper. After we go into the Zoo folder there are Animals and ZooEmployees folder. In the Animals folder, it has the details of different species and in the ZooEmployees folder, it contains the details about the Zookeeper. <br>

###Issues:
Initially, we have difficulties to separate the code into multiple files. Mostly because of haven't written the code in Java. So, we have to go over the "Package" tutorial in Java on the internet. <br>
Also, we need to go over the 'git' information to know how to push the code into GitHub. <br>

###Execution:
Run this Project using commend (under this dir): <br>
$ javac main.java <br>
$ java main <br>
